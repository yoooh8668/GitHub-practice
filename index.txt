    Create new branch => cat.
    And test merge function.
    Push function test.
        $git branch <new branch>                        //create new branch
        $git checkout <branch_name>                     //set HEAD to <branch_name>
        $git checkout -b <branch_name> 
            /*if (<branch_name> EXIST?){
                git checkout <branch_name>}
              else{
                git branch <branch_name>
                git checkout <branch_name>}
            */

        $git merge <other_branch_name>                  //merge <other_branch_name> to current branch

        $git push origin <branch_name>                  //push <branch_name> to server, if <branch_name> dosen't exist, creat one.
        $git push origin <target_branch>:<branch_name>
            /*push <branch_name> to server named <target_branch>, 
              if <target_branch> dosen't exist, creat one.
              
              if (<target_branch> == <branch_name> && <target_branch> EXISTS)
                  "$git push origin <branch_name>"
            */
        $git push origin <branch_name>                 //see $git push origin <target_branch>:<branch_name>

        $git push -u origin <branch_name> 
            /*craet <branch_name> on origin(remote-target)
              set upstream on itself.
              next time, you can just type "$git push"
              (One branch can only has one upstream)
            */

2020-4-17_conflict-practice
    Create 2 branch(1-st/2-nd) and edit "conflict-target.txt"
    When conflict cteates, modify the file and re-add & re-commit.
    During confilct, HEAD is outside the branches.
    After conflict, HEAD is return back to the current branch.
    

2020-04-20_reset-rebase
    A.switch to certain commit
        $git reset <commit> --hard          //add "--hard" to make sure that all file are changing to that state.
    B.split commit
        $git rebase -i <commit>             //"edit" commit you want to split
        $git reset HEAD^                    //reset the state of the commit
        $(split commit by your require)
        $git rebase --continue              //close rebase mode
    C.combine commit
        $git rebase -i <THE ABOVE COMMIT>   //"edit" THE ABOVE COMMIT you want to combine
        $(combine commits by your require)
        $git rebase --continue              //close rebase mode
    D.insert commit
        $git rebase -i <THE ABOVE COMMIT>   //"edit" THE ABOVE COMMIT you want to insert to
        $(add new commits by your require)
        $git rebase --continue              //close rebase mode
